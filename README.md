# Volleyball Webpage

## Overview
This project was created to showcase my ability to learn and build a professional webpage using Next.js and React. The website is a simple and clean featuring a smooth interactivce feature for users / coaches to keep track of players in game. 
Built with modern web technologies, this project demonstrates component-based architecture and responsive design principles.

## Why I made this
I developed an interactive rotation tracking feature specifically designed for coaches. Having experience with coaching, I understood the challenge of managing rotations on whiteboards or paper while trying to focus on the game. I built this digital tool to
simplify rotation management, allowing coaches to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on strategy and player development.
