# Volleyball Webpage

## Overview
This project was created to showcase my ability to learn and build a professional webpage using Next.js and React. The website is a simple and clean featuring a smooth interactivce feature for users / coaches to keep track of players in game. 
Built with modern web technologies, this project demonstrates component-based architecture and responsive design principles.

## Why I made this
I developed an interactive rotation tracking feature specifically designed for coaches. Having experience with coaching, I understood the challenge of managing rotations on whiteboards or paper while trying to focus on the game. I built this digital tool to
simplify rotation management, allowing coaches to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on strategy and player development.

Live Demo: CodeSandbox


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
